                    Maxicore is dedicated to saving you both time and money. For instance, if you see 20 patients a day and spend about two minutes charting each one, that totals approximately 40 minutes daily. By delegating charting to a virtual assistant, you could see an additional 2 patients per day. With an average revenue of $70 per patient, this could increase your earnings by $150 daily, amounting to around $3,000 per month.

                    Maintaining HIPAA compliance and safeguarding your PHI is our top priority. All our MVAs are HIPAA-certified and comply with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 in the Philippines. We also require NBI clearances, which are akin to FBI background checks in the U.S. To ensure compliance, clients should have MVAs sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Our company does not access PHI, so we are not required to sign a BAA. You can provide EMR access via direct login credentials with restricted access or through a secure remote desktop setup. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 provides protections similar to HIPAA, ensuring accountability in the event of data breaches.

                  <p>
                    The Data Privacy Act of 2012 in the Philippines offers robust protection for sensitive information, comparable to HIPAA in the U.S. It holds Philippine citizens accountable for data breaches, even when working with entities outside the country. Our medical virtual assistants are bound by this law, ensuring that sensitive data is safeguarded. We also conduct comprehensive vetting and background checks and advise that you have the virtual assistant sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Additionally, we recommend performing regular HIPAA security audits to maintain ongoing compliance.
